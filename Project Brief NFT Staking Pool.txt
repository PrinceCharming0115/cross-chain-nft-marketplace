-Project Brief: NFT Staking Pool with Time-Locked Tokens

-Project Overview
This project involves the creation of a unique NFT (Non-Fungible Token) staking pool. Users will be able to deposit their NFTs into the pool for a fixed period, earning rewards in the form of time-locked tokens. These tokens will be claimable in predetermined batches following a vesting cliff.

-Key Features
NFT Staking Duration: Users can deposit their NFTs into the pool for a period of 6 months. During this time, rewards will accumulate.

Omni-Chain Integration: Utilizing Layer Zero technology for cross-chain interactions, enabling users to stake NFTs on Ethereum and receive rewards on Manta Pacific.

Rewards Distribution: Post the 6-month staking period, the accumulated rewards will be distributed in the form of tokens. These tokens will be locked initially and will become eligible for claim every week, spread evenly over 12 months.

Multiple NFT Staking: Users have the flexibility to stake more than one NFT. The platform will support multiple NFT deposits from a single user.

Reward Correlation: The amount of tokens earned as rewards will be directly proportional to the total number of NFTs staked by the user. This encourages users to stake more NFTs for higher rewards.

-Technical Specifications
Smart Contract Development: The platform will utilize smart contracts to manage NFT deposits, reward calculations, and token distributions. These contracts will be deployed on Ethereum.

Vesting Schedule Implementation: A vesting schedule will be programmed into the smart contracts to ensure that the rewards are time-locked and released according to the predefined schedule.

User Interface: A user-friendly interface will be developed for users to easily stake their NFTs, view their staked NFTs, track accrued rewards, and claim tokens.

Security Measures: Robust security protocols will be implemented to safeguard the staked NFTs and the accrued rewards. This includes regular audits and compliance checks.

Scalability Considerations: The system will be designed to efficiently handle a large number of staking transactions and multiple users staking various NFTs.

Layer Zero Technology Integration: The platform will leverage Layer Zero technology for seamless communication between Ethereum and Manta Pacific, ensuring a smooth and efficient user experience across different blockchains.

Dual Blockchain Functionality: The system will operate across two blockchains - Ethereum for NFT staking and Manta Pacific for token reward distribution.

-Core Smart Contract Parameters

NFT Staking Parameters

stakeDuration: The fixed period for which NFTs can be staked (set to 6 months).

nftContractAddress: Address of the NFT contract on Ethereum.

stakedNFTs: Mapping of user addresses to an array of staked NFT IDs.

stakeStartTime: Timestamp indicating when an NFT is staked.

stakeEndTime: Timestamp when the staking period ends (calculated based on stakeStartTime + stakeDuration).

-Reward Distribution Parameters

rewardTokenContractAddress: Address of the reward token contract on Manta Pacific.

totalReward: Total amount of tokens to be distributed as rewards.

rewardDistributionDuration: Duration over which the rewards are distributed (set to 12 months).

weeklyReward: Amount of reward to be distributed weekly (calculated based on totalReward / number of weeks in rewardDistributionDuration).

rewardClaimStartTime: Timestamp indicating when reward distribution begins.

claimedRewards: Mapping of user addresses to the amount of rewards claimed.

-Layer Zero Integration Parameters

crossChainMessagingProtocol: Details of the Layer Zero messaging protocol used for communication between Ethereum and Manta Pacific.

sourceChain: Identifier for the Ethereum blockchain.

destinationChain: Identifier for the Manta Pacific blockchain.

crossChainTransferFunction: Function to handle cross-chain transfers of rewards.

-User Management Parameters

userStakeCount: Mapping of user addresses to the count of their staked NFTs.

isStaked: Mapping of NFT IDs to boolean values indicating whether they are staked.

Security and Compliance Parameters

admin: Address of the contract's administrator, typically for emergency control.

pauseStaking: A boolean control to temporarily halt staking in case of issues.

smartContractAuditLogs: Records of security audits and compliance checks.

-Events for Transaction Tracking

Staked: Event emitted when an NFT is staked.

Unstaked: Event emitted when an NFT is unstaked (if applicable).

RewardClaimed: Event emitted when rewards are claimed.

-Miscellaneous Parameters

stakingCap: Maximum number of NFTs that can be staked in the pool (if any limit is to be set).

updateRewardRate: Function to adjust the reward rate based on market conditions or other factors.

-Additional Considerations
Upgradability: Implementing a proxy contract pattern to allow for future upgrades without losing the current state.

Gas Optimization: Efficient coding practices to minimize gas costs, especially important given the cross-chain operations.

Error Handling: Robust error checking and handling to ensure smooth contract execution.


-------------------------------------

Project Overview:
Your task is to develop a blockchain-based NFT system. This system should be capable of supporting functionalities related to NFT staking, reward distribution, and cross-chain operations using Layer Zero technology. The primary focus will be on creating a robust and secure platform that facilitates the staking of NFTs and the distribution of rewards across different blockchains.

Key Objectives:

Develop Smart Contracts: Write and deploy smart contracts for NFT staking and reward management. Pay special attention to the integration of Layer Zero technology for omni-chain functionality.

Ensure Cross-Chain Compatibility: The platform should operate seamlessly between Ethereum (for NFT staking) and Manta Pacific (for reward distribution).

Security and Testing: Ensure the highest standards of security are met. Rigorous testing is essential to identify and rectify any vulnerabilities.

Key Deliverables:

Omnichain NFT 'ONFT' Smart Contract: Develop and deploy a smart contract for managing the NFTs, ensuring it supports cross-chain functionality. The contract should handle NFT minting, transfers, and cross-chain communication.

Omnichain ERC20 Token Contract: Develop a smart contract for an ERC20 token that supports cross-chain interoperability. Ensure the contract includes standard ERC20 functionalities like transfer, balance tracking, and allowance mechanisms.

Omnichain NFT Staker Contract: Create a smart contract specifically for staking NFTs. Include functionalities for staking, un-staking, Time Locking, Reward Claiming and tracking staked NFTs.

Staking Rewards Logic: Implement the logic for calculating and distributing staking rewards. Ensure the reward mechanism is fair, transparent, and scalable.
